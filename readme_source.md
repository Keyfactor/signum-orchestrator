If you created it with the suggested value, this step can be skipped.
7. Start the Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator Service.
8. In Keyfactor Command, go to Orchestrators => Management and approve the Keyfactor Orchestrator containing the Signum capability that you just installed by selecting the orchestrator and clicking APPROVE.

## Creating an Signum Certificate Store in Keyfactor Command  
To create a Keyfactor Command certificate store of certificate store type Signum, go to Locations => Certificate Stores and click ADD.  Then enter the following:  
- Category - Signum (or the alternate ShortName value you entered when creating your certificate store type).
- Container - Optional.  Refer to Keyfactor Command documentation about this feature.
- Client Machine - The URL that will be used as the base URL for Signum endpoint calls.  Should be something like https://{base url for your signum install}/rtadminservice.svc/basic. The API service port can be configured so yours may use something other than default https/443.  The "/basic" at the end is required, as this integration makes use of Basic Authentication only when consuming the Signum SOAP API library.- Store Path - Not used and hardcoded to NA for "not applicable"
- Server Username and Server Password - The id/password credentials that have authorization to execute Signum SOAP endpoints in your Signum environment.
