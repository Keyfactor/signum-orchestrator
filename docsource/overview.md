## Overview

The Signum Universal Orchestrator extension enables seamless integration between Keyfactor Command and the Signum platform for remote management of cryptographic certificates. Signum uses certificates for securing communications and ensuring the authenticity and integrity of data exchanged within its ecosystem.

In Keyfactor Command, defined Certificate Stores of the Certificate Store Type represent collections of certificates or a single certificate stored in a remote location. For the Signum integration, these Certificate Stores refer to endpoints within the Signum platform that handle certificates as specified in the integration configuration. This setup allows for efficient management, inventory, and automation of certificate-related operations within the Signum environment.
